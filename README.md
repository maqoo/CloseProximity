# CloseProximity lap timer

## Why Close Proximity

The original algorithms of Chorus Lap Timer are very simple and effective. However, in my opinion, they are not fair for everybody. Close Proximity ensures that the measurement is taken fairly. 

Also not much of configuration is needed (channel / band only).

And the iOS app has more functionalities, which were tested in the field.

## How

This hex file can be used to alter the [Chorus Lap Timer project](https://github.com/voroshkov/Chorus-RF-Laptimer).

Just [upload](https://github.com/euphy/polargraph/wiki/Uploading-precompiled-binary-hex-files) this [hex file](CloseProximity.ino.hex) into your assembled lap timer.

## Mobile App

This project is NOT compatible with the original Chorus Lap Timer Android app.
New application on iOS (Close Proximity) will be available soon through Apple's Appstore.

There is a beta iOS app version available.

Unfortunately, the Android compatible solution is not available yet.

## Bluetooth

To communicate with an iOS device, a BLE device is needed. We use HM-10 devices for our tests.

## Beta

If you would like to participate in beta testing, [let me know](mailto:mstramski@gmail.com) :)
